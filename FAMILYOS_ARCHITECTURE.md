## 4. Decoupled Identity, Membership, Guardian & Permission Model

A critical architectural requirement in FamilyOS is separating five distinct concepts:
1. **Authenticated User Account (`UserAccount`)**: Owned exclusively by the identity provider (Firebase Auth). Stores NO passwords, hashes, or auth secrets.
2. **Family Membership (`FamilyMembership`)**: Connects an authenticated user account to a specific family workspace with a verified role.
3. **Family Member Profile (`FamilyMember`)**: The household human representation (name, birthday, dietary rules, milestones). Can exist independently without an account (crucial for minor children, dependents, or elderly family members).
4. **Guardian Relationship (`GuardianRelationship`)**: Explicit legal/parental stewardship mapping which adult accounts supervise which minor profiles.
5. **Permission Assignment (`PermissionAssignment`)**: Verified server-side capabilities (not client-side UI toggles).

```

```

### Architectural Enforcement Rules:
1. **No Password Storage**: Zero password hashes or plain secrets are stored in the local SQLite database. Firebase Auth handles all credential verification.
2. **Biometrics as Device Protection**: Local biometric unlock (Fingerprint/Face) is strictly an on-device gate for app access convenience and does not replace server-authoritative Firebase token refresh.
3. **Child Profiles Without Accounts**: Minor children have a `FamilyMember` profile and a `GuardianRelationship` entity. A child profile is NOT an authenticated account. Guardian-managed devices provide pin-protected access to view assigned chores and achievements.
4. **Server-Side Authorization**: Permissions are validated on Firebase Cloud Functions / Firestore security rules. Client UI visibility is purely ergonomics, not a security boundary.

---

## 5. Dependency Injection Topology

Using standard Hilt scoping:
- `@Singleton`: Room Database, DataStore, Network Client, WorkManager Scheduler, Encryption Engine.
- `@ViewModelScoped`: Repositories, Domain Use Cases, Navigation Coordinators.
- `@ActivityRetainedScoped`: Workspace Context Manager (keeps active `currentFamilyId` stable across rotations).

## 6. Backend Integration & Secure Gemini AI Gateway

### 6.1 Direct SDK vs Proxy Strategy
Direct client-side Gemini API calls are strictly forbidden in production because:
1. Android APK decompilation can expose embedded API keys.
2. Direct API keys prevent centralized household rate-limiting and quota enforcement.
3. Client-side prompts cannot safely sanitize family privacy data before transit.

### 6.2 FamilyOS AI Gateway Architecture:
```
[Android Jetpack Compose] 
       | (HTTPS Bearer Token Auth)
       v
[Cloud Run / Firebase Cloud Functions: /api/ai/*]
       | 
       +---> 1. Validate Firebase JWT & verify Family Membership
       +---> 2. Apply rate-limiting & parental consent check
       +---> 3. Strip PII (names replaced with tokenized placeholders: Member_A, Member_B)
       +---> 4. Call @google/genai SDK (Gemini 2.5 Flash / Pro)
       +---> 5. Enforce structured JSON Schema response

## 7. Master Stage 2 — Unified Planning, Canonical Task & Privacy Architecture (Milestone 3.3.2)

1. **7-Tier Deterministic Rollup Hierarchy**:
   - `Family Mission` → `Family Vision` → `Goals` → `Projects` → `Milestones` → `Tasks` → `Checklists`.
   - Progress rolls up deterministically from checklist item completion to tasks, milestones, projects, and goals without hardcoded progress bars or duplicate progress tables.
2. **Scope Privacy & Role Governance**:
   - `PERSONAL` goals, projects, tasks, and task-linked calendar events are visible and mutable only by `ownerMemberId` / `creatorMemberId`.
   - `COUPLE` goals and `MARRIAGE`-module tasks are restricted to adult couple members (`OWNER`, `ADMIN`, or `SELF`/`SPOUSE_PARTNER`).
   - `CHILD` members can complete assigned tasks/checklists and create self-tasks, but cannot assign tasks to other family members or delete shared adult tasks.
3. **Single Canonical Task Engine**:
   - A single canonical `Task` model (`productivity_tasks` / `planningTasks`) with `sourceModule` (`GOALS_PROJECTS`, `HOME_MANAGEMENT`, `MARRIAGE`, `PARENTING`, `SPIRITUAL_GROWTH`, `FAMILY_GOVERNANCE`, `PERSONAL_PLANNING`) serves the entire platform, with bidirectional `CALENDAR_EVENT` synchronization and `EVENT_BASED_MERGE` offline checklist conflict resolution.

---

## 8. Master Stage 2 — Shared Calendar, Reusable Routines & Notification Architecture (Milestone 3.3.3)

1. **Authoritative Calendar Architecture**:
   - Standalone and task-linked events unified under `AuthoritativeCalendarEvent` and Android Room `calendar_events`.
   - Supports all-day flags (`isAllDay`), UTC millisecond epoch timestamps, and IANA timezone strings (`America/Los_Angeles`).
   - Standard categories: `BIRTHDAY`, `ANNIVERSARY`, `GOAL_DUE`, `TASK_DUE`, `MEAL`, `CHORE`, `MAINTENANCE`, `FAMILY_EVENT`, `APPOINTMENT`, `ROUTINE`, `SPECIAL_OCCASION`.
2. **Zero-Trust Scope Privacy**:
   - `PERSONAL`: Accessible strictly to creator / assigned members.
   - `COUPLE`: Accessible strictly to adult partner members (`OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `SELF`/`SPOUSE_PARTNER`); filtered out completely for `CHILD` and `GUEST` roles.
   - `FAMILY`/`SHARED`: Visible to all authenticated members (with `GUEST` having read-only access).
3. **Decoupled Routines & Occurrence Execution**:
   - A `Routine` defines the cadence, target weekdays, target time, checklist steps template, and points reward.
   - A `RoutineOccurrence` represents an isolated execution instance on a target date (`occ-${routineId}-${targetDate}`).
   - **Critical Decoupling Invariant**: Marking an occurrence completed or checking off steps **NEVER completes or deletes the parent Routine definition**. The routine stays active for future days while updating streak metrics (`streakCount`, `bestStreakCount`) and awarding gamified family points.
4. **Promotion / Conversion of Routine Occurrence to Canonical Task**:
   - Promotes routine occurrence into a canonical task (`sourceModule: ROUTINES`) with cloned checklist items and automatic calendar synchronization.
5. **Month-End Anchor Day Calculation**:
   - Month-end anchor day preservation ensures recurring events on the 29th–31st safely clamp to the last valid day of shorter months (e.g., Feb 28 or 29) with `isClamped: true` and automatically restore to the 31st in longer months.
6. **SQLCipher Room v4 Durable Routine Persistence**:
   - Replaces in-memory StateFlows with durable, encrypted Room SQLite tables: `routines` (40) and `routine_occurrences` (41).
   - Upgraded via non-destructive `MIGRATION_3_4` with zero data loss across existing 39 tables.
   - Local mutations are committed to encrypted SQLite storage *before* updating UI flows, ensuring complete survival across app process termination and restarts.
7. **Native Event Editing & Recurrence Exception Mechanics**:
   - Interactive `EditCalendarEventDialog` in `CalendarScreen.kt` allows editing timestamps, categories, privacy scopes, IANA timezones, location, and notes.
   - Recurrence exception toggling allows targeting the entire series or appending the target date to `recurrenceExceptions` to modify a single instance without breaking the recurrence rule.
8. **Native Android Notification Delivery Subsystem**:
   - `CalendarReminderScheduler`: Coordinates with Android `AlarmManager` using `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()` and exact alarm permissions (`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`).
   - `CalendarReminderReceiver`: BroadcastReceiver executing in `familyos_reminders_channel` with **Zero-Trust Privacy Concealment** (strips sensitive titles for `COUPLE` and `PERSONAL` scopes on lockscreens).
   - `BootReceiver`: Recovers and reschedules active event alarms on `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `ACTION_TIME_CHANGED`, and `ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED`.

---

## 9. Master Stage 3 — Finance, Growth & Wellbeing Architecture (Milestones 3 & 3.2)

1. **Exact 64-Bit Integer-Cents Financial Engine**:
   - Zero floating-point representation (`Float`/`Double` strictly forbidden for monetary arithmetic).
   - All monetary calculations are performed in `Long` integer cents (e.g. `$100.50` = `10050L`).
   - Atomic balance updates, write-ahead transaction logging, and strict duplicate transaction prevention via deterministic idempotency keys (`idempotency_key`).
2. **Category Envelope Budgets & Dynamic Spent Rollups**:
   - Reactive spent rollup computes `EnvelopeBudget.spentCents` from posted expenses and reversals without manual, error-prone balance columns.
   - Threshold warnings fire at configured percentages (e.g. 80%) before exceeding monthly allocations.
3. **Available Planned Cash-Flow Allocator**:
   - Formula: `Planned Cash Flow = Projected Income - Fixed Monthly Obligations - Envelope Budgets - Savings Commitments`.
   - Prevents over-allocation and enables confident savings milestone funding.
4. **Non-Destructive Transaction Reversals**:
   - Financial ledger entries are never hard-deleted; audit integrity is maintained via compensating reversal transactions linked to the original `transaction_id`.
5. **Guardian-Gated Health & Safety Boundaries**:
   - Minor health profiles, medication dosages, and medical appointments require verified guardian authorization (`FamilySecurityPolicy.canAccessChildMedicalRecords`).
   - Offline emergency preparedness directory (`emergency_contacts`, `safety_supplies`, `emergency_plans`) remains accessible instantly without network connectivity.
