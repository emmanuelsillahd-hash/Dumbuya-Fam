# FAMILYOS — MASTER PROJECT PLAN
**Status**: STAGE 0 (Architecture and Product Foundation)  
**Author**: Principal Software Architect & Product Lead  
**Target Platform**: Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room, MVVM Clean Architecture) & Cloud Backend (Firebase / Gemini)  
**Revision**: 1.0.0 (Stage 0 Baseline)

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Product Vision

**FamilyOS** is a commercial-grade, premium digital operating system for household and family life. Its mission is to unite responsibilities, financial stewardship, shared goals, meal and household planning, spiritual reflection, personal growth, child development, health routines, emergency preparedness, and long-term investments in an offline-first, privacy-respecting, aesthetically elevated platform.

### Core Tenets:
1. **Offline-First & Resilient**: All operational household tasks, recipes, meal plans, schedules, and checklists function seamlessly without network access using local SQLite/Room with explicit synchronization queuing and conflict policies.
2. **Strict Financial Integrity**: Zero floating-point math (`Float` / `Double` strictly prohibited for currency). All currency stored and computed as 64-bit integer cents (`Long`), with certified rounding and audit trails.
3. **Decoupled User Accounts vs Family Profiles**: A family member profile can exist independently of an authenticated account (essential for minor children, dependents, or elderly relatives without mobile devices).
4. **Deny-by-Default Privacy & Child Protection**: Strict boundary isolation between families, granular role-based permissions, zero covert surveillance, and no sharing of children's data with AI models or external trackers.
5. **No AI Hallucinations in System of Record**: All AI-assisted suggestions (meal planning, goal breakdown, chore balance) require mandatory human review and explicit confirmation before persistence.

## 5. Development Governance & Standards

- **Single Source of Truth**: All progress, schema changes, and architectural decisions are tracked in the 10 canonical documents.
- **Verification Gate**: No stage or feature is declared complete without automated unit/integration tests and build verification.
- **Strict Coding Style**: Kotlin 2.0+ idiomatic patterns, strict null safety, immutable data classes (`val`), Kotlin Result/Arrow error handling, and Jetpack Compose state hoisting.
